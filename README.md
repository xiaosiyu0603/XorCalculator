# Read Me of XorCalculator

### Introduction

  A calculate program that can make "exclusive or" operation byte by byte for the input file. Interesting and fortunately, the program can "exactly" decode the cache of NetEase Music.

### Theory

  The program read a byte and xor `0xA3` , then write the answer to output file immediately.
(Why 0xA3? See the reference)

### Usage

  Drag the file on the exe (e.g. `.uc` file in "...\Cache"), the program will output the file at where input file is. You may manual change the extension to ".flac" instead of ".mp3" at certain times.
